    'text' : 'Today I wrote a code for this blog. As for now it has very basic look and options. \
              Posts are added from an array of elements. In future it will be loaded from JSON. \
              I\'m going to update blog regular and I hope I will handle it. During work on this blog I learned \
              new thing for me: appending element to the DOM after another chosen element with "insertBefore" method. \
              I\'m curious how many people will read my reflections.'
