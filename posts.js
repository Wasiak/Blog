    'text' : 'Today I wrote a code for this blog. As for now it has very basic look and options. \
              Posts are added from an array of elements. In future it will be loaded from JSON. \
              I\'m going to update blog regular and I hope I will handle it. During work on this blog I learned \
              new thing for me: appending element to the DOM after another chosen element with "insertBefore" method. \
              I\'m curious how many people will read my reflections.'

    'text' : 'This week I finished my first comercial project. Thanks to my friend Micha≈Ç, who is my mentor and for now my boss ;) \
              He helped me in coding harder parts of code and again gave my countless advices and tips. During this project I\'ve been using \
              Fabric.js framework to draw elements on canvas and make them movable, rotatalbe and scalable. I learned many new technics of coding \
              and knew many new options available in JavaScript. One of completely new thing for me was writing a requests to comunicate with server. \
              Till now I have no idea how it works but now I understand it, of course I know only basic way of using it but next time I will \
              use requests it will take me much less time to code it correctly. In some next post I will write about some problems which I had \
              during this project and ways of solving it with specific example.'
